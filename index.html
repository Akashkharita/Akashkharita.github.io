    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I'm a machine learning practitioner and researcher with a strong background in signal processing, deep learning, and scientific computing. I hold a dual Master’s degree, and have applied data-driven approaches to challenging real-world problems like seismic event classification, anomaly detection, and pattern recognition in noisy environments. My work blends traditional research rigor with modern AI techniques — I've built and deployed deep learning models for earthquake-explosion discrimination, surface event detection, and automated labeling of geophysical data. These models are not only scientifically accurate but also computationally efficient and scalable.
        I'm currently exploring the intersection of data science and physical sciences, and I enjoy working on projects where machine learning drives real impact. I'm now looking to bring my skills to a mission-driven data science or ML engineering team that values innovation, precision, and curiosity.
